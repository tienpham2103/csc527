a)
  x1  |  x2  |  bk  |  yk
  0   |  0   |  0   |  1
  0   |  -1  |  0   |  0
  1   |  0   |  0   |  1
  1   |  -1  |  0   |  1
  Therefore, yk will be active when x1 = 1 or x2 = 0 (x1 OR !x2)
  
b)
  x1  |  x2  |  bk  |  yk
  0   |  0   |  1   |  1
  0   |  -1  |  1   |  1
  1   |  0   |  1   |  1
  1   |  -1  |  1   |  1
  Therefore, yk will always be active
  
c) There are 3 possible combinations of the inputs:
  - 2 excitatory signals
  - 2 inhibitory signals
  - 1 excitatory signal and 1 inhibitory signal
  
d) bk can be any number

e) There are 3 possible types of MP neuron:
  - 2 excitatory signals as input --> OR function
  - 2 inhibitory signals as input --> NOR function
  - 1 excitatory signal and 1 inhibitory signal as input --> OR function (x1 OR !x2)
